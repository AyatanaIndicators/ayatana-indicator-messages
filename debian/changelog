indicator-messages (0.1.3-0ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Ted Gould ]
  * New upstream version.
    - Now changes the icon based on non-IM indicators so that Evolution
      works much better.  (LP: #342480)
    - Now the menu items are in a predictable order, alphabetical.
    - The Messages for a particular client (i.e. Pidgin) are grouped with
      the client they're associated with.
    - Adjusting the icon size to match the new one in the Human theme.
    - Adjusting the build so that all the different libraries are not
      built in a versioned manner.  Now it's just one .so, which is
      what it should have been originally.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
